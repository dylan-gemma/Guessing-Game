Guessing-Game

This is a basic number guessing game built with html, javascript, and css. Guess a number between 1 and 20 against a randomly generated number. Each round allows 20 guesses until you lose the game. The highscore is equal to the lowest number of guesses taken to guess the correct number. Good luck!





This game is based on a similar game from "The Complete JavaScript Course 2021: From Zero to Expert!" led by Jonas Schmedtmann.
